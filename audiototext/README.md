## 💖 Project Story

This project began as something personal — a gift for my girlfriend, **Aruuke**.  
I wanted to make her studies easier by building a tool that could quickly and accurately turn lectures and recordings into text.

As time went on, I realized that many other students face the same challenges.  
So I decided to share **AruuNote** with the world.  
What started as a project for one person now helps many — transforming audio into clarity and convenience for learners everywhere.
